##PROBLEM: Given a user-input number N, print all Fibonacci
##    numbers up to (but strictly less than) N.
##
##ALGORITHM: I solved this problem as follows:
##    1. This is what I do first.
##    2. Then I do this.
##    3. Then I either do:
##        a. this; or maybe
##        b. that.
##    4. Then I end with the other.
##
##ERROR HANDLING:
##    1. User is re-prompted until an int > 0 is entered.
##       Any other input is ignored.
##
##OTHER COMMENTS:
##    Anything else someone needs to know goes here.
